# WHICH CHARACTER ARE YOU?

This Application is a "Which Character Are You? quiz. It is similar to a buzzfeed quiz and it is based on a popular television show called Schitt's Creek. It allows the user to take a personality quiz and then gives the user a character based on how they answered the questions. Each outcome had a curated Spotify playlist to go along with it. The playlist was incorporated using a Spotify widget. The Application was created using Ruby on Rails and deployed on Heroku.
